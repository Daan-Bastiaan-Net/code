            I had 1 Year of informatica during my middleschool period, and 1 Year of programming lessons. These lessons stuck by me and made me enjoy programming which I want to do.<br>
The English study program of HZ was the best one I could find in the Netherlands.<br>
I found the program on Studie Keuze 123 where it was the one that fit me best.<br>
The world is getting more and more technological, programming and data are a large part in that. I want to be able to help and understand the progress that is made.<br>
